/**
 * <p>A Task is simple implementation that allows you to make calls to the
 * server to process actions, store or retrieve data, etc. Useful for any
 * client-server like applications, e.g. Emails, Instant Messaging, etc</p>
 *
 * <p>Any global variables that are initialized in this class, wont be on the server side.
 * To initialize them, first store the data in the NBT tag provided in {@link #prepareRequest(CompoundTag)},
 * then once your Task gets to the server, use {@link #processRequest(CompoundTag, Level, Player)} to
 * get the data from the NBT tag parameter. Initialize the variables as normal.
 *
 * <p>Please check out the example applications to get a better understanding
 * how this could be useful to your application.</p>
